# Lead Acid Battery Charger
Lab project for the third semester at ENTC-UoM

This project is designed to charge a 12V lead acid battery with a maximum current of 1A using PWM switch mode power supply with a feedback voltage. This lead acid battery charger is using constant current and constant voltage charging techniques to charge the battery.
